I made a leap into the world of software development in 2020 and haven't looked back since. My journey has been both diverse and rewarding, with a particular focus on frontend technologies. I thrive on turning ideas into reality and constantly seek new challenges to enhance my skills.Whether you're an employer looking for a passionate developer or a fellow enthusiast keen on collaboration, I'd love to connect! Feel free to explore my projects or drop me a message.
